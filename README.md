# Overview
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts. 

# Project Goals
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

# Technology Stack
1. Django: A Python-based web framework used for building the backend APIs and handling the server-side logic.
2. PostgreSQL: A relational database used for storing all structured data such as users, bookings, properties, and reviews.
3. GraphQL (optional): Can be used for more flexible API querying if the project extends beyond REST.
4. HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Used for frontend development.
5. Docker: Used for containerizing the application and managing development environments.
6. GitHub Actions: A CI/CD tool for automating testing and deployment workflows.

# Team Roles
## Backend Developer
Responsible for building the core application logic and RESTful APIs using Django. Handles data validation, processing, and interaction with the database.
## Frontend Developer
Designs and implements the user interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and optionally React). Ensures the application is responsive and user-friendly.
## Database Administrator
Manages the database design, optimizes queries, handles migrations, and ensures data integrity and security.
## DevOps Engineer
Sets up deployment environments, manages CI/CD pipelines, and monitors performance and infrastructure.
## QA Engineer
Writes and runs automated/manual tests to ensure the application works as expected and catches bugs before release.

# Database Design
## Key Entities
1. Users
id: Unique identifier
username: Userâ€™s display name
email: Contact email
role: Either guest or host
date_joined: Registration date
2. Properties
id: Unique identifier
owner_id: Linked to User
title: Name of property
location: Address/city
price_per_night: Cost of stay
3. Bookings
id: Unique identifier
user_id: Linked to User
property_id: Linked to Property
start_date: Booking start
end_date: Booking end
4. Reviews
id: Unique identifier
user_id: Reviewer
property_id: Reviewed property
rating: Numeric rating
comment: Optional text
5. Payments
id: Unique identifier
booking_id: Linked to Booking
amount: Payment total
status: Paid, pending, failed
payment_date: Timestamp
Relationships
A user can own multiple properties.
A user can make multiple bookings.
Each booking is for one property.
A property can have many reviews.
Each booking has one associated payment.

# Feature Breakdown
## User Management
Handles user registration, login, profile management, and authentication.
## Property Management
Allows hosts to list, update, or remove their properties, including uploading images and setting pricing.
## Booking System
Enables users to view availability and make reservations on listed properties.
## Review System
Lets guests leave reviews and rate their stays, helping improve trust and feedback.
## Payment Integration
Processes and records secure payments for bookings, supporting multiple payment methods.

# API Security
## Authentication
Only registered users can access protected routes (e.g., creating a booking or listing a property). JWT or session-based authentication can be used.
## Authorization
Different roles (guest vs. host) will have different permissions, such as only hosts being allowed to manage properties.
## Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse by limiting how often a user can make requests to the API.
## Why Security Matters
User Data: Protects personal info like email, password, and payment data.
Payments: Ensures financial transactions are secure and verifiable.
System Integrity: Prevents unauthorized access and service disruption.

# CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) helps automate testing and deployment of code changes.
## Tools
GitHub Actions: For running automated tests and triggering builds.
Docker: For consistent local and production environments.
Heroku/Render: Possible deployment platforms for staging/production.
By using CI/CD, every code change can be tested automatically, reducing bugs and speeding up development.
